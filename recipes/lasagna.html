        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. It is 
                usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made from a 
                dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants. After being 
                boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in layers with 
                a filling that varies based on different local traditions.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Cook noodles according to package directions; drain. Meanwhile, in a 
                    Dutch oven, cook sausage, beef and onion over medium heat 8-10 minutes 
                    or until meat is no longer pink, breaking up meat into crumbles. Add 
                    garlic; cook 1 minute. Drain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir in tomatoes, tomato paste, water, sugar, 3 tablespoons parsley, 
                    basil, fennel, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce 
                    heat; simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a small bowl, mix egg, ricotta cheese and remaining 1/4 cup 
                    parsley and 1/4 teaspoon salt.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Preheat oven to 375°. Spread 2 cups meat sauce into an ungreased 13x9-in.
                     baking dish. Layer with 3 noodles and a third of the ricotta mixture. 
                     Sprinkle with 1 cup mozzarella cheese and 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese. 
                     Repeat layers twice. Top with remaining meat sauce and cheeses (dish will 
                    be full).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake, covered, 25 minutes. Bake, uncovered, 25 minutes longer or until bubbly. 
                    Let stand 15 minutes before serving.
